ActiveSupport provides a to_xml method that produces appealing XML for ActiveRecord objects and arrays and hashes containing ActiveRecord objects. The xml_serialization gem extends that XML serialization support to allow for arrays and hashes containing strings, symbols, and integers.

The xslt_render plugin for rails depends on this gem.
